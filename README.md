# small-declarative-fdap

## Declarative traces enumerator for small declarative systems

SageMath code to calculate all traces of a small (<=10 activities/actions) declarative system.

File pt1.sage contains the main code whereas constraints_fema.sage contains the declarative constraints specific to the declarative model of the Federal Disaster Assistance Policy.

See workbook_for_fema.sage for how to recreate the data.

The declarative process to filename correspondences are as follows:

D_{FDAP}:   fema_modnull

D_{FDAPM1}: fema_mod1

D_{FDAPM2}: fema_mod2

D_{FDAPM3}: fema_mod3

## NOTE:

All trace data has already been created so there is no need to recreate these files.

(In some instances they can take several hours.)

The text files of all traces are included, simply locate the .txt file that corresponds to the .sobj file.
